# A script to create a mappable edition of the stations.csv database.
# To create GeoJSON from `stations.csv` download the stations.csv file and pipe through

#	stations2geojson.rb < stations.csv > stations.geojson
# This script is designed to be short and simple. No error or conformance checking is
# performed.
